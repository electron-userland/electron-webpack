# Extending as a Library

One of the great benefits of using `electron-webpack` is that the entirity of `webpack`'s documenation still applies. You can easily skip using the provided CLI and modify the configurations to meet your needs. Since `electron` uses a multi-process architecture, there are also multiple `webpack` configurations. Let's cover what's provided.

### Configuration Files

* `electron-webpack/webpack.main.config.js` (`main` process)
* `electron-webpack/webpack.renderer.config.js` (`renderer` process)
* `electron-webpack/webpack.renderer.dll.config.js` (Dll bundle spliting)

If you are wanting to look at these configurations internally, you can easily do the following to print them into your console. Notice that each configuration returns a `Promise`.

```js
const webpackMain = require('electron-webpack/webpack.main.config.js')
const { inspect } = require('util')

webpackMain().then(config => {
  console.log(inspect(config, {
    showHidden: false,
    depth: null,
    colors: true
  }))
})
```

## Adding a Custom Loader/Plugin

Let's say we need to support `*.txt` files in our `renderer` process and want to use the `raw-loader` to do so, here's how we can get that setup.

##### Install `raw-loader`
```bash
yarn add -D raw-loader
```

##### myCustomWebpack.renderer.config.js
```js
const webpackRenderer = require('electron-webpack/webpack.renderer.config.js')

module.exports = env => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

    /* get provided config */
    webpackRenderer(env).then(rendererConfig => {

      /* add `raw-loader` */
      rendererConfig.module.rules.push({
        test: /\.txt$/,
        use: 'raw-loader'
      })

      /* return modified config to webpack */
      resolve(rendererConfig)
    })
  })
}
```

Now with your new custom webpack configuration file, you can use the native [`webpack` CLI](https://webpack.js.org/api/cli/).

```bash
webpack --config myCustomWebpack.renderer.config.js
```
